# App Store Server API Purchase Validation Example

This repository demonstrates how to validate App Store purchases using the App Store Server API and the `app-store-server-library` in Python. It provides a practical example of integrating Apple's server-side validation for in-app purchases and subscriptions.

## Features

- Load and use Apple Root Certificates for secure communication
- Create a `SignedDataVerifier` for transaction verification
- Set up an `AppStoreServerAPIClient` for interacting with the App Store Server API
- Validate App Store purchases using transaction IDs
- Handle pagination for transaction history requests
- Error handling and logging for API interactions and verification processes

## Key Components

- `load_certificates()`: Loads Apple Root Certificates from specified file paths
- `create_signed_data_verifier()`: Sets up a `SignedDataVerifier` instance
- `create_app_store_client()`: Initializes an `AppStoreServerAPIClient`
- `validate_app_store_purchase()`: Core function to validate a purchase using a transaction ID

## Usage

1. Replace placeholder values in the configuration section with your actual App Store Connect credentials
2. Ensure you have the necessary certificates and private key file
3. Run the script to validate an App Store purchase

## Requirements

- `app-store-server-library` package

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages: `pip install app-store-server-library`
3. Update the configuration variables in the script
4. Run the script: `python example.py`

This example provides a foundation for implementing App Store purchase validation in your Python projects using the latest App Store Server API.
